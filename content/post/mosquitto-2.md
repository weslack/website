## Challenge

See if you have the patience to scratch the itch; patience is key. Mosquitto bites are so annoying! Except, in this case.. you can become an admin. Connect at: x.x.x.x:x using iot:iot Web Portal: http://x.x.x.x


## Solve

Look at the new Mosquitto server.

Grab the text that looks like a flag.

Base64 decode the username and password.

Base64 decode the image containing the OTP before a new image appears

Use the credentials to get the flag.
